## Usage

```typescript
import mlx from '@frost-beta/mlx';
const {core: mx, nn} = mlx;

const model = new nn.Sequential(
  new nn.Sequential(new nn.Linear(2, 10), nn.relu),
  new nn.Sequential(new nn.Linear(10, 10), new nn.ReLU()),
  new nn.Linear(10, 1),
  mx.sigmoid,
);
const y = model.forward(mx.random.normal([32, 2]));
console.log(y);
```

## APIs

There is currently no documentations for JavaScript APIs, please check the
TypeScript definitions for available APIs, and [MLX's official website](https://ml-explore.github.io/mlx/)
for documentations.

The JavaScript APIs basically duplicate the official Python APIs by converting
the API names from snake_case to camelCase. For example the `mx.not_equal`
Python API is renamed to `mx.notEqual` in JavaScript.

There are a few exceptions due to limitations of JavaScript:

* JavaScript numbers are always floating-point values, so the default dtype
  of `mx.array(42)` is `mx.float32` instead of `mx.int32`.
* The `mx.var` API is renamed to `mx.variance`.
* Operator overloading does not work, use `mx.add(a, b)` instead of `a + b`.
* Indexing via `[]` operator does not work, use `array.item` and
  `array.itemPut_` methods instead (the `_` suffix means inplace operation).
* `delete array` does nothing, you must wait for garbage collection to get the
  array's memory freed or use `mx.dispose`.
* The `Module` instances can not be used as functions, the `forward` method must
  be used instead.

### Unimplemented features

Some features are not supported yet and will be implemented in future:

* The `distributed` module has not been implemented.
* The `mx.custom_function` API has not been implemented.
* The `export` APIs have not been implemented.
* The custom Metal kernel has not been implemented.
* It is not supported using JavaScript Array as index.
* The function passed to `mx.vmap` must have all parameters being `mx.array`.
* The captured `inputs`/`outputs` parameters of `mx.compile` has not been
  implemented.
* When creating a `mx.array` from JavaScript Array, the Array must only include
  primitive values.
* The APIs only accept plain parameters, e.g. `mx.uniform(0, 1, [2, 2])`. Named
  parameter calls like `mx.uniform({shape: [2, 2]})` has not been implemented.
* The `.npz` tensor format is not supported yet.

### JavaScript-only APIs

There are a few new APIs in node-mlx, for solving
[JavaScript-only problems](https://github.com/frost-beta/node-mlx/issues/2).

#### Constructor of `mx.array`

You can pass following JavaScript types to `mx.array`:

* `number`/`boolean`/`mx.Complex`
* `Array<T>`
* `new Array(length)` - Creates a 1D array filled with 0.
* `Buffer` - Same with `UInt8Array`.
* `Int8Array`/`Uint8Array`/`Int16Array`/`Uint16Array`/`Int32Array`/`Uint32Array`/`Float32Array`

#### `mx.array.toTypedArray`

While it is possible to use the `tolist()` method of `mx.array` to convert the
array to JavaScript `Array`, a copy of data is invovled.

For 1D arrays whose dtype has a representation in JavaScript
[`TypedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray),
you can use the `toTypedArray()` method to expose the data to JavaScript without
copying.

```typescript
const buffer: Uint8Array = mx.array([1, 2, 3, 4], mx.uint8);
```

#### `mx.asyncEval`

The `mx.eval` API is synchronous that the main thread would be blocked waiting
for the result, which breaks the assumption of Node.js that nothing should block
in main thread, and results in a hanging process that not responding to
anything, including tries to end the process with Ctrl+C.

The `mx.asyncEval` API is the asynchronous version that returns a Promise that
can be awaited for. It is useful when the program runs a large model and you
want to make the app alive to user interactions while doing computations.

```typescript
const y = model.forward(x);
await mx.asyncEval(y);
```

#### `mx.tidy`

This is the same with [`tf.tidy`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#tidy)
API of TensorFlow.js, which cleans up all intermediate tensors allocated in the
passed functions except for the returned ones.

```typescript
let result = mx.tidy(() => {
  return model.forward(x);
});
```

In addition, it also works with async functions.

```typescript
await mx.tidy(async () => { ... });
```

### `mx.dispose`

This is the same with [`tf.dispose`](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/latest/#dispose)
API of TensorFlow.js, which cleans up all the tensors found in the object.

```typescript
mx.dispose({ a: mx.array([1, 2, 3, 4]) });
mx.dispose(mx.array([1]), mx.array([2]));
```

### Complex numbers

There is no built-in complex numbers in JavaScript, and we use objects to
represent them:

```typescript
interface Complex {
  re: number;
  im: number;
}
```

You can also use the `mx.Complex(real, imag?)` helper to create complex numbers.

### Indexing

Slice in JavaScript is represented as object:

```typescript
interface Slice {
  start: number | null;
  stop: number | null;
  step: number | null;
}
```

You can also use the `mx.Slice(start?, stop?, step?)` helper to create slices.

The JavaScript standard does not allow using `...` as values. To use ellipsis as
index, use string `"..."` instead.

When using arrays as indices, make sure a integer dtype is specified because
the default dtype is `float32`, for example
`a.index(mx.array([ 1, 2, 3 ], mx.uint32))`.

Here are some examples of translating Python indexing code to JavaScript:

## Building

For building on platforms other than Macs with Apple Silicon, you must have blas
installed.

```bash
# Linux
sudo apt-get install -y libblas-dev liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev
# x64 Mac
brew install openblas
```

This project is mixed with C++ and TypeScript code, and uses
[cmake-js](https://github.com/cmake-js/cmake-js) to build the native code.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/frost-beta/node-mlx.git
cd node-mlx
npm install
npm run build -- -p 8
npm run test
```

### Releasing

The prebuilt binaries are uploaded to the GitHub Releases, when installing
node-mlx from npm registry, the prebuilt binaries will always be downloaded and
there is no fallback for building from source code.

The version string is always `0.0.1-dev` in `package.json`, which means local
development, and npm package can only be published via GitHub workflow by
pushing a new tag.

### Versioning

Before matching the features and stability of the official Python APIs, this
project will stay on `0.0.x` for npm versions.

## Syncing with upstream

The tests and most TypeScript source code were converted from the Python code
of the official MLX project, when updating the `deps/mlx` submodule, review
every new commit and make sure changes to Python APIs/tests/implementations are
also reflected in this repo.
